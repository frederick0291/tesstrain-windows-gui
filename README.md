Please don't forget this fork is for Windows GUI implementation developed by only one developer (so far). The Tesseract and Tesstrain projects for which this GUI  is created are much larger open source projects.

## Install

The GUI executable is portable. You can copy the `tesstrain_gui.exe` file to any directory and execute it.

### Requirements

You will need version 4 or newer of Tesseract executables (that include the
training tools and matching leptonica bindings).

You can download executables built from the latest code version using the [zdenop's
AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/zdenop/tesseract/build/artifacts). 

You will also need a copy of 'traineddata' which you can find for example on the [official Tesseract
website](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/#traineddata-files). Make sure you will download the
model marked as 'best' if you want to use it as a 'Start model' for your new model (the 'fast' one cannot be
used as a 'Start model').

If you prefer, you can also [build](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Compiling.html#windows) and 
[install](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Compiling-%E2%80%93-GitInstallation)
binaries on your own. More information can be found in the [Tesseract User
Manual](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/).

### Python

You need a recent version of Python 3.x. For image processing the Python library `Pillow` is used.
If you don't have a global installation, the GUI will try to install `Pillow` and other required Python modules on
the first run.
'python' or 'python3' command must be working from the project's directory (Python's executable folder should be
in your PATH environment variable).

### Language data

Tesseract expects some configuration data (a file `radical-stroke.txt`). It will be downloaded automatically by the GUI when needed from [this address](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/langdata_lstm/raw/main/radical-stroke.txt) and placed in the configurable "Output data directory".


## Choose model name

Tesstrain GUI will ask you for a name for your model. By convention, Tesseract stack models including
language-specific resources use (lowercase) three-letter codes defined in
[ISO 639](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) with additional
information separated by underscore. E.g., `chi_tra_vert` for **tra**ditional
Chinese with **vert**ical typesetting. Language-independent (i.e. script-specific)
models use the capitalized name of the script type as identifier. E.g.,
`Hangul_vert` for Hangul script with vertical typesetting. In the following,
the model name is referenced by `MODEL_NAME`.

## Provide ground truth

Place ground truth consisting of line images and transcriptions in a folder of your choice (default: 
`data/MODEL_NAME-ground-truth`). GUI will generate list of those files, and split into training and evaluation data, the ratio can be defined in the GUI.

Images must be in `.tif`, `.png`, `.bin.png`, `.nrm.png` or `.bmp` format.

Transcriptions must be single-line plain text and have the same name as the
line image but with the image extension replaced by `.gt.txt`. If any supported
image file won't have corresponding `.gt.txt` file, you will be asked for content on the
start of training, and it will be saved in a proper file.

The repository contains a folder with sample ground truth, see
[ocrd-testset](./ocrd-testset).

**NOTE:** If you want to generate line images for transcription from a full
page, see tips in [issue 7](https://github.com/OCR-D/ocrd-train/issues/7) and
in particular [@Shreeshrii's shell
script](https://github.com/OCR-D/ocrd-train/issues/7#issuecomment-419714852).

## Train

Execute the `tesstrain_gui.exe` and follow the displayed instructions.
